#10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From '
line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

hcount = dict()                                     
hlst = []                                           

for line in handle: 
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) > 2 and words[0] == 'From':       
        hr = words[5].split(':')                    
        hcount[hr[0]] = hcount.get(hr[0], 0) + 1    
    else:
        continue

for k,v in hcount.items():                           
    hlst.append((k,v))                            

hlst.sort()                                         
for k,v in hlst:                                  
    print (k,v)
